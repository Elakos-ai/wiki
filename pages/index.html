    <p>Hello everyone! I am Adil Dzhabrailov.I live in <a href="https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Az%C9%99rbaycan"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Azerbaijan </a>
        in the city of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B8%D1%82"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Sumgait</a>. I
        was born on August 27, 2007. I am also a first-year student of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology" style="text-decoration: none;">IT
            specialty</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Engineering_University"
            style="text-decoration: none;">the Baku
            Engineering University (BEU)</a> .I am a person living in the era of digital progress, where technology, <a
            href="https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0nternet" style="text-decoration: none;">Internet</a>
        and virtual worlds have become an integral part of life. Since childhood, I have been drawn to devices,
        buttons, screens and mysterious worlds behind monitors. Computers and games have become more than just
        entertainment for me, but a window into the endless world of knowledge and opportunities.An integral part of my
        life has become one fps shooter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Counter Strike</a>. I literally grew up on this game. Also, since childhood,
        my
        father instilled in me an interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Chess</a> and other different board games. I see my future in IT and want to
        advance in this field in the future.

    <p>I am a big fan of detective series, especially those that focus on psychology, intelligence, and the inner
        struggles of the characters. Some of my favorites are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Dexter</a> , <a
            href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82_(%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB)"
            style="text-decoration: none;">
            The
            Mentalist</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(TV_series)"
            style="text-decoration: none;">YOU</a> .

        What appeals to me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Dexter</a> is the unique protagonist, a serial killer who works as a blood
        expert for the
        police. His double life, strict moral code, and struggle with his inner demons make the plot incredibly
        gripping. I love watching him balance between the darkness inside him and the desire to be “normal.”</p>
    <br>
    <p> In <a
            href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82_(%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB)"
            style="text-decoration: none;">
            The
            Mentalist</a>, I really like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Jane"
            style="text-decoration: none;">Patrick Jane</a>>, a man with incredible intelligence and observation skills
        who
        uses
        his skills to solve crimes. His methods are unconventional, his charisma is strong, and his personal tragedy
        adds depth to everything.</p>
    <br>
    <p>

        I watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(TV_series)" style="text-decoration: none;">YOU</a> because
        of the unusual presentation - the story is told from the perspective of a man who seems
        charming and scary at the same time. I'm interested in the topic of boundaries, manipulation, and how easily a
        person can justify even the darkest actions if he believes that he is doing it "in the name of love."

        Such series hook me because they are not just about crimes. They are about the inner world of people, their
        secrets, weaknesses, strength of mind, and struggle with themselves. I love stories where each character is not
        black and white, but multi-layered, and where every action has consequences.
